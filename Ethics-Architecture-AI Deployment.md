# Operational Blueprint for Physical AI Deployment (v1.6)

## Overview

This document presents an advanced architecture for physical AI agents operating in open and complex environments, focusing on robustness, reproducibility, and embedded ethics. The design combines multimodal perception, episodic-semantic SQL-based memory, ternary logic (-1, 0, +1) for decision-making under uncertainty, and an introspective learning loop to create an autonomous and responsible entity.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation between perception, memory, decision-making, cognition, learning, and operational interfaces.
- **Episodic-Semantic Memory:** Highly structured temporal logs (SQL ACID), modular ontologies, efficient queries (B-tree, HNSW), versioning, and smart compression.
- **Ternary Decision Logic:** Explicit representation of positive, negative, and undecided states, with uncertainty propagation and ethical conflict resolution.
- **Advanced Diagnostics:** Metrics such as Î¼DP and MDPi for fine introspection and decision stability monitoring.
- **Introspective Learning:** Priority replay, bias mitigation, drift detection, and knowledge preservation.
- **Ethics First:** Explicit mediation between ethical risk, task continuity, and safety, respecting regulations such as GDPR.
- **Human Interfaces:** Natural dialogue, real-time monitoring, alert escalation protocols, and open external APIs.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Benchmarks in Habitat 3.0 with sensor dropout and real-world cases including urban deliveries, scientific fieldwork, environmental drones, and industrial maintenance.
- **Open Source:** Clear specifications, latency budgets, and enumerated threat models to ensure reproducibility.
